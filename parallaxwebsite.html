          Thankyou for showing interest, 
          here is a quick story of me and
          this website. My programming 
          journey started back in 2022, 
          few months before I started 
          studying CSE in Malineni Perumallu College. 
          I am currently in my final
          year and doing Technical 
          Content Writing Internship
          at GeeksForGeeks. I like 
          coding all kind of problems 
          from the very basic like adding 
          numbers to the complex ones like
          competitive programming problems.
          I love making projects and games.
          Infact this website is one of my 
          Web Development Projects which 
          is built using HTML and CSS.<br>
          <br>Languages known : C Language, 
          C++, JAVA, Python, JavaScript, 
          MySQL.<br> IT Constructs : Data 
          Structures and Algorithm, OOP, 
          HTML, CSS, LINUX, and Git & GitHub.
